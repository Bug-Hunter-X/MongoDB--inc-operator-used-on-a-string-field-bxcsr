# MongoDB $inc Operator Error

This example demonstrates an error that occurs when attempting to use the `$inc` operator on a string field in MongoDB. The `$inc` operator is only for numerical fields.  The solution shows how to correctly handle this situation, potentially by converting the string to a number before incrementing or using a different approach depending on the desired outcome.
